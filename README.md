### Home
The home screen starts with a featured product randomly selected using the `getFeaturedProduct()` function inside the `app_provider.dart` file. This function utilizes a random number generator from the [dart:math ](https://api.dart.dev/stable/3.2.3/dart-math/dart-math-library.html) library. Featured products use hero animation for a smooth transition between screens. The main page also contains a categories filter and a short list of products that can be expanded by clicking on the `SEE ALL` button.

### Profile drawer
By clicking on the profile icon in the app bar, users can access the profile drawer. This information is also obtained from the public API.

### Product detail
The screen includes additional product information and provides an "Add to Cart" functionality. When the user adds an item to the cart, a `View Cart` button is provided as a shortcut. This screen also includes rating stars using the [flutter_rating_bar](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_rating_bar) package.

### Cart
Add, remove, update, or empty all items using the [provider](https://pub.dev/packages/provider) package. The shopping cart employs the dismissible effect for easy item removal.
